This CSV Importer app (mock) is built using Nextjs, Papa Parse and React Table. It was one of the apps I built during my front-end software developer job at OmniGeo Solutions. Users can upload their CSV files to the app with different values. The app used a CSV parser called - Papa Parse to get all the CSV values, and render them to a table with React Table. The users can edit their CSV files before submitting them to our server. I also integrated NextAuth, a Nextjs authentication solution to make sure users log in before uploading their CSV files. This app is deployed to vercel after finishing building.
